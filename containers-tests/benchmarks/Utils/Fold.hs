-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- foldr_elem, foldl_elem
--   Simple lazy fold that visits every element. In practice:
--   * Worst case for short-circuiting folds
--   * Data.Foldable.toList
--
-- foldr_cpsSum, foldr_cpsOneShotSum, foldl_cpsSum, foldl_cpsOneShotSum
--   The well-known foldl'-via-foldr pattern. GHC.Exts.oneShot is used to help
--   GHC with optimizations. In practice:
--   * Used for early-return with an accumulator
--   * Used by the foldl library
--
-- foldr_traverseSum, foldr_traverseSum
--   Folding with an effect. In practice:
--   * Folds defined using foldr, such as Data.Foldable.traverse_ and friends
--
-- foldl', foldr'
--   Strict folds.
--
-- foldMap_elem
--   Simple lazy fold that visits every element. In practice:
--   * Worst case for lazy folds defined using foldMap, such as
--     Data.Foldable.any, Data.Foldable.find, etc.
--
-- foldMap_traverseSum
--   Folding with an effect. In practice:
--   * With the lens library, using traverseOf_ on a foldMap based fold.
