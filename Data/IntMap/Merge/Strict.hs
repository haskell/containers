--
-- This module defines an API for writing functions that merge two
-- maps. The key functions are 'merge' and 'mergeA'.
-- Each of these can be used with several different \"merge tactics\".
--
-- The 'merge' and 'mergeA' functions are shared by
-- the lazy and strict modules. Only the choice of merge tactics
-- determines strictness. If you use 'Data.Map.Merge.Strict.mapMissing'
-- from this module then the results will be forced before they are
-- inserted. If you use 'Data.Map.Merge.Lazy.mapMissing' from
-- "Data.Map.Merge.Lazy" then they will not.
--
-- == Efficiency note
--
-- The 'Control.Category.Category', 'Applicative', and 'Monad' instances for
-- 'WhenMissing' tactics are included because they are valid. However, they are
-- inefficient in many cases and should usually be avoided. The instances
-- for 'WhenMatched' tactics should not pose any major efficiency problems.
