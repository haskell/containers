-- = Finite Int Sets
--
-- The @'IntSet'@ type represents a set of elements of type @Int@. An @IntSet@
-- is strict in its elements.
--
-- For a walkthrough of the most commonly used functions see their
-- <https://haskell-containers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/set.html sets introduction>.
--
-- These modules are intended to be imported qualified, to avoid name
-- clashes with Prelude functions, e.g.
--
-- >  import Data.IntSet (IntSet)
-- >  import qualified Data.IntSet as IntSet
--
--
-- == Implementation
--
-- The implementation is based on /big-endian patricia trees/.  This data
-- structure performs especially well on binary operations like 'union'
-- and 'intersection'. Additionally, benchmarks show that it is also
-- (much) faster on insertions and deletions when compared to a generic
-- size-balanced set implementation (see "Data.Set").

--
-- Additionally, this implementation places bitmaps in the leaves of the tree.
-- Their size is the natural size of a machine word (32 or 64 bits) and greatly
-- reduces the memory footprint and execution times for dense sets, e.g. sets
-- where it is likely that many values lie close to each other. The asymptotics
-- are not affected by this optimization.
--
--
-- == Performance information
--
-- The time complexity is given for each operation in
-- [big-O notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), with \(n\)
-- referring to the number of entries in the map and \(W\) referring to the
-- number of bits in an 'Int' (32 or 64).
--
-- Operations like 'member', 'insert', and 'delete' have a worst-case
-- complexity of \(O(\min(n,W))\). This means that the operation can become
-- linear in the number of elements with a maximum of \(W\) -- the number of
-- bits in an 'Int' (32 or 64). These peculiar asymptotics are determined by the
-- depth of the Patricia trees:
--
-- * even for an extremely unbalanced tree, the depth cannot be larger than
--   the number of elements \(n\),
-- * each level of a Patricia tree determines at least one more bit
--   shared by all subelements, so there could not be more
--   than \(W\) levels.
--
-- If all \(n\) elements in the tree are between 0 and \(N\) (or, say, between
-- \(-N\) and \(N\)), the estimate can be refined to \(O(\min(n, \log N))\). If
-- the set is sufficiently "dense", this becomes \(O(\min(n, \log n))\) or
-- simply the familiar \(O(\log n)\), matching balanced binary trees.
--
-- The most performant scenario for 'IntSet' are elements from a contiguous
-- subset, in which case the complexity is proportional to \(\log n\), capped
-- by \(W\). The worst scenario are exponentially growing elements \(1,2,4,
-- \ldots,2^n\), for which complexity grows as fast as \(n\) but again is capped
-- by \(W\).
--
-- Binary set operations like 'union' and 'intersection' take
-- \(O(\min(n, m \log \frac{2^W}{m}))\) time, where \(m\) and \(n\)
-- are the sizes of the smaller and larger input sets respectively.
